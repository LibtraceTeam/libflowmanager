Version 2.0.2
-------------
 * Added a new config option (LFM_OPTION_TCP_ANYSTART) which will enable the
   creation of TCP flows for non-SYN packets. These new flows will begin with
   a 120 sec timeout, but will become established if a second packet is
   observed for the flow.
 * Improved performance by reducing the number of map lookups per packet.
 * Client / Server is now determined based on packet direction rather than the
   return value of trace_get_server_port(). This is a more consistent and 
   simple approach than before, but may result in a lot of client/server swaps
   when comparing new results against results generated with an older version
   of libprotoident.
 * Flow Id numbers are now 64 bit values.
 * Fixed bug where get_client_ip() would return an inappropriate value for an
   IPv6 flow.
 * Fixed a compilation problem with newer versions of gcc.

Version 2.0.1
-------------

 * Version only used internally within WAND.


Version 2.0.0
-------------
 * Added support for IPv6 flows
 * Slight API change - get_client_ip_str() and get_server_ip_str() functions
   for the flow ID now take a pointer to a string as a parameter, which is 
   updated to contain the IP address string. Previously, a static string was
   created and returned by these functions, which created a "use it or lose 
   it" scenario.
 * Fixed bug where a TCP flow was treated as established without seeing a SYN
   ACK
 * Fixed bug when the source and destination ports match
 * Restructured source code directories
 * Flows in the TCP half-close state now expire after only 4 minutes
 * UDP flows now expire after 2 minutes rather than 2 mins 20 secs
 * Added example program that demonstrates how the API should be used
 * Linking against C++ programs should now work properly.
 * Fixed bug with the DirectionInfo destructor.
