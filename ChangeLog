Version 2.0.0
-------------
 * Added support for IPv6 flows
 * Slight API change - get_client_ip_str() and get_server_ip_str() functions
   for the flow ID now take a pointer to a string as a parameter, which is 
   updated to contain the IP address string. Previously, a static string was
   created and returned by these functions, which created a "use it or lose 
   it" scenario.
 * Fixed bug where a TCP flow was treated as established without seeing a SYN
   ACK
 * Fixed bug when the source and destination ports match
 * Restructured source code directories
 * Flows in the TCP half-close state now expire after only 4 minutes
 * UDP flows now expire after 2 minutes rather than 2 mins 20 secs
 * Added example program that demonstrates how the API should be used
 * Linking against C++ programs should now work properly.
 * Fixed bug with the DirectionInfo destructor.
